# Local Network

You can deploy a local Astria Network and EVM rollup in multiple ways. Deploying
with the [`astria-go` CLI](../tutorials/run-local-rollup-and-sequencer.md) will
setup a minimum viable sequencer and rollup for lightweight local development,
and using the [Astria Deployment Charts](../developer/deployment-charts.md)
will deploy the entire Astria Stack but requires more resources.

## Endpoints
