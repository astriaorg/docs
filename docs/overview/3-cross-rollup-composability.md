# Cross-Rollup Composability

<!--@include: ./../components/_deployment-instructions-redirect.md-->

Because Astria handles the transaction ordering for multiple rollups, itâ€™s able
to provide guarantees that transactions are only included as part of an atomic
bundle. This allows users to specify that a transaction on Rollup A can be
included in a block if and only if a different transaction on Rollup B is also
included in the same block. By enabling such conditional transaction inclusion,
Astria unlocks exciting possibilities such as atomic cross-rollup arbitrage.
