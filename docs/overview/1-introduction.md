# Introduction

<!--@include: ./../components/_deployment-instructions-redirect.md-->

<DeploymentsRedirect />

Astria is a shared sequencing network that allows many rollups to share a single
decentralized network of sequencers. These sequencers are simple and
permissionless to join, completely replacing centralized sequencers.

This shared sequencer network provides out-of-the-box censorship resistance,
fast block confirmations, and atomic cross-rollup composability – all while
retaining each rollup’s sovereignty. Astria envisions a future where thousands
of decentralized rollups flourish, each one tailored to meet the unique
requirements of different industries, applications, and use cases.

To achieve this vision, we believe that deploying an economically secure,
decentralized, and censorship-resistant rollup should be as easy as deploying a
smart contract.

## What should I read?

Want to learn more about the sequencer? check out the [Astria overview section](/overview/2-why-decentralized-sequencers.md)
If you're a developer eager to get started, you should go straight to our Quick Start guide, which will walk you through deploying a rollup full node on a local Kubernetes cluster which uses the Astria shared sequencer network. Once you've gone through the Quick Start, you can move on to running on cloud.
You can find our endpoints and FAQ [here](/astria-evm/overview.md)

## What If I Need More Help?

While this documentation should include everything you need, if you can't find what you're looking for, please reach out to us on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/AstriaOrg) or check the [Astria repository](https://github.com/astriaorg/astria).
