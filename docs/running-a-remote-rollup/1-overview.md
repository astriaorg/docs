# Overview

After running the Astria stack locally, the next step is to run a rollup against
the remote Astria network.

As before with running a local dev-cluster, you will need to have the
[dev-cluster](https://github.com/astriaorg/dev-cluster/tree/main) and the main
[astria repo](https://github.com/astriaorg/astria) cloned and on your machine.
