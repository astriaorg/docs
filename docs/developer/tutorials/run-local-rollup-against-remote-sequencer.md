# Run a Local Rollup against a Remote Sequencer

This guide will walk you through running a local Geth rollup against a remote Astria
sequencer, using the `astria-go` cli to run the required components of the
Astria stack locally on your machine.

## Setup a Geth Rollup

### Build Geth

Requires `Go`, `just`, and `Foundry`:

- Go: https://go.dev/doc/install
- just: https://github.com/casey/just
- Foundry: https://book.getfoundry.sh/getting-started/installation

Open a new terminal window and clone and build Geth.

```bash
git clone git@github.com:astriaorg/astria-geth.git
cd astria-geth
git checkout local-dev
just build
```

### Configure the Geth Genesis Information

Once you have built the Geth node, you will need to update some
additional genesis information to work with the remote sequencer. 

Run the following using the Astira cli:

```bash
astria-go sequencer blockheight --url https://rpc.sequencer.dusk-5.devnet.astria.org
```

Then, open the `geth-genesis-local.json` file and update the `chainId` and
`astriaRollupName` to something of your choosing, as well as updating
`astriaSequencerInitialHeight` using the block height from the previous command
to choose which sequencer block the first block of your rollup will be in:

```json
    "config": {
        ...
        "chainId": <6 digit number>,
        "astriaRollupName": "<your rollup name>",
        "astriaSequencerInitialHeight": <sequencer block height>,
        ...
    },
```

Keep the `chainId` and `astriaRollupName` you chose on hand, as they will also
be needed for running the [test transactions](./test-transactions.md) and
[configuring the Astria composer](#configure-the-local-astria-components) later on.

:::tip
When starting a new rollup, it is always best to use the most recent height of
the remote Sequencer for your rollup's initial sequencer height. The Astria
Conductor will always start syncing the rollup from the
`"astriaSequencerInitialHeight"` provided. Using older block heights
will work but will cause your rollup to sync potentially millions of blocks that
have no relevant data for your new rollup.
:::

Create a new genesis account for your Geth rollup:

```bash
cast w new
```

Also in the `geth-genesis-local.json` file, update the `"alloc"` account with
your new one:

```json
   "alloc": {
        "<your new address>": { "balance": "300000000000000000000" }
    }
```

You will use the private key for your new account with the [test
transactions](./test-transactions.md) later on.

## Start Geth

In your Geth terminal window, run the following to initialize and run the Geth rollup:

```bash
# in astria-geth dir
just init
just run
```

If you need to restart the rollup, you can stop the program with `Ctrl+C` and
restart with:

```bash
just run
```

If you need to restart the rollup and want to also clear the state data, you can use:

```bash
# in astria-geth dir
just clean-restart
```

## Configure the Local Astria components

Open a new terminal window and initialize the cli:

```bash
astria-go dev init
```

When running against the remote sequencer, you will also need to create a new
sequencer account.

```bash
astria-go sequencer create-account
```

Navigate to the `~/.astria` directory. If you have run the commands shown above,
you should find a `default` directory.

Open the `~/.astria/default/config-remote/.env` file and update the following
environment variables. Use the same rollup name you used for [setting up
Geth](#setup-a-geth-rollup) above, and the private key from the sequencer
account you just created.

```bash
ASTRIA_COMPOSER_ROLLUPS="<your rollup name>::ws://127.0.0.1:8546"
ASTRIA_COMPOSER_PRIVATE_KEY="<sequencer account private key>"
```

::: warning
Only update `<your rollup name>` in `ASTRIA_COMPOSER_ROLLUPS`.
:::

You can then use the [Sequencer
Faucet](https://faucet.sequencer.dusk-5.devnet.astria.org/) to fund the account
you just created using the account address.

## Run the local Astria components against the Remote Sequencer

Run the local Astria components against the remote sequencer:

```bash
astria-go dev run --remote
```

When running against the remote sequencer, you will see a TUI that displays the logs
of the Astria Conductor and Composer:

## Test your Rollup

To test that your rollup and the sequencer are configured and running correctly,
you can follow the [Test Transactions instructions
here](./test-transactions.md).
