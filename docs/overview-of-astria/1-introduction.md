# Introduction

Astria replaces centralized sequencers, allowing many rollups to share a single
decentralized network of sequencers that’s simple and permissionless to join.

This shared sequencer network provides out-of-the-box censorship resistance,
fast block confirmations, and atomic cross-rollup composability – all while
retaining each rollup’s sovereignty.
Astria envisions a future where thousands of decentralized, sovereign rollups
flourish, each one tailored to meet the unique requirements of different
industries, applications, and use cases. 

To achieve this vision, we believe that
deploying an economically secure, decentralized, and censorship-resistant
sovereign rollup should be as easy as deploying a smart contract.
