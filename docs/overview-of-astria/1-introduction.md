# Introduction

:::tip
To deploy your own rollup on the Astria Dusknet devnet, check out the
[instructions here](/docs/dusknet/overview/)!
:::

Astria is a shared sequencing network that allows many rollups to share a single
decentralized network of sequencers. These sequencers are simple and
permissionless to join, completely replacing centralized sequencers.

This shared sequencer network provides out-of-the-box censorship resistance,
fast block confirmations, and atomic cross-rollup composability – all while
retaining each rollup’s sovereignty.
Astria envisions a future where thousands of decentralized rollups
flourish, each one tailored to meet the unique requirements of different
industries, applications, and use cases. 

To achieve this vision, we believe that
deploying an economically secure, decentralized, and censorship-resistant rollup
should be as easy as deploying a smart contract.
