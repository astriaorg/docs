# Maintain Sovereignty

Sovereignty is important, so rollups must be able to receive the benefits of
Astria without fear of being locked in. That’s why swapping out the sequencing
layer is as simple as updating a rollup node’s software to use a different fork
choice rule at a chosen block height. Transaction data is stored on the base
layer (eg. Celestia), and rollup full nodes hold the state and perform
execution, this means there’s nothing that Astria can do to hold the rollup
hostage.
