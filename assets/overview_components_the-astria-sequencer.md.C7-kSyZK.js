The unique feature of the sequencer is that the transactions it includes are not executed (lazy sequencing), and are destined for another execution engine (ie. a rollup). This excludes “sequencer native” transactions, such as transfers of tokens within the sequencer chain. Transactions from any given rollup are only ordered on the sequencer, not executed.</p><p>The sequencer node can optionally act as a “validator”, meaning it actively participates in the production and finalization of new blocks.</p><p><img src="'+r+'" alt="Astria Shared Sequencer"></p><p>Components of note that are not shown in the above diagram are the <a href="./composer">Composer</a>, <a href="./relayer">Relayer</a>, and <a href="./conductor">Conductor</a>.</p><p>These components facilitate the delivery transactions, batches, and different commits shown above, back to the users.</p>',6),i=[s];function c(h,d,u,l,p,_){return t(),a("div",null,i)}const q=e(o,[["render",c]]);export{m as __pageData,q as default};
