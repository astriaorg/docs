And yet, today’s rollups almost universally depend on a single sequencer. Centralized sequencers provide fast transaction confirmations and reduce costs by batching and compressing transactions. However, these benefits come at the cost of relying on a single trusted actor for liveness and censorship resistance.</p><p><strong>Sacrificing decentralization for an improved user experience is an unacceptable Faustian bargain.</strong></p><p>Astria tackles centralization head-on, providing rollups with a decentralized sequencer and even better UX. Astria’s shared sequencer network is a middleware blockchain with its own decentralized sequencer set which accepts transactions from multiple rollups. These transactions are ordered into a single block and written to the base layer without executing them.</p><p><img src="'+r+'" alt="Shared Sequencers"></p>',6),o=[i];function c(l,d,p,u,h,_){return n(),t("div",null,o)}const f=e(s,[["render",c]]);export{y as __pageData,f as default};
