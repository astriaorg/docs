These sequencers are simple and permissionless to join, completely replacing centralized sequencers.</p><p>This shared sequencer network provides out-of-the-box censorship resistance, fast block confirmations, and atomic cross-rollup composability – all while retaining each rollup’s sovereignty. Astria envisions a future where thousands of decentralized rollups flourish, each one tailored to meet the unique requirements of different industries, applications, and use cases.</p><p>To achieve this vision, we believe that deploying an economically secure, decentralized, and censorship-resistant rollup should be as easy as deploying a smart contract.</p><h2 id="what-should-i-read" tabindex="-1">What should I read? <a class="header-anchor" href="#what-should-i-read" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;What should I read?&quot;">​</a></h2><p>Want to learn more about the sequencer? check out the <a href="/overview/2-why-decentralized-sequencers">Astria overview section</a> If you&#39;re a developer eager to get started, you should go straight to our Quick Start guide, which will walk you through deploying a rollup full node on a local Kubernetes cluster which uses the Astria shared sequencer network.
