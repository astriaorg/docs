At a minimum, the sequencer network needs to implement a decentralized leader selection algorithm which rotates between proposers. Ideally, it is also able to provide single-slot (“fast”) finality, which prevents forks from occurring, allowing for simplified chain derivation logic on the rollups which use it. CometBFT is able to provide both of these. Additionally, CometBFT is battle-tested and has been used in production, on many chains, for years. It allows blockchain applications (application, in this case, meaning the chain’s execution logic) which implement ABCI (Application Blockchain Interface) to easily use it as their consensus layer. Additionally, CometBFT-enabled chains have the ability to support IBC (inter-blockchain communication), meaning they have the potential to bridge between many other chains.",-1),l=e("p",null,"Astria sequencer’s execution logic is implemented as a CometBFT application, written in Rust.
